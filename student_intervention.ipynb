In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

The boundary should be drawn so as to maximize the margin,and the margin is the distance between the support vectors.With that in mind, we can draw an optimal hyperplane which successfully separate \"good students\" and \"bad students\".Often, though, it's not easy to draw a decision boundary in low dimensions, so the SVM separates the passing and failing students by 3D dimensions, that is know as the kernel trick.\n",
